# InfluxDB 3 uses a different initialization approach
# The database/bucket is created via environment variables during container startup:
# - INFLUX_SETUP_BUCKET
# - INFLUX_SETUP_ORG
# - INFLUX_SETUP_TOKEN
# - INFLUX_SETUP_USERNAME
# - INFLUX_SETUP_PASSWORD
# - INFLUX_SETUP_RETENTION

# This script can be used for additional setup tasks if needed
echo "InfluxDB 3 initialization completed via environment variables"

# Note: InfluxDB 3 handles retention differently than 1.8
# Retention is set per bucket, not as separate policies
# Multiple buckets would be needed to replicate the one_month, one_year, forever pattern
