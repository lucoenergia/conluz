# Conluz

![Build & Test](https://github.com/lucoenergia/conluz/actions/workflows/java_ci_with_gradle.yml/badge.svg)

Welcome to Conluz, the energy community management application!

Conluz is a robust application designed for the efficient management of an energy community. This platform enables the administration of community members and their corresponding supply points. Functioning as an API-driven solution, Conluz facilitates the retrieval of consumption data for each supply point, production data from the energy plant, and real-time electricity prices.

The application focuses on seamless interaction with the underlying infrastructure through a RESTful API, offering a streamlined and programmatic approach to community energy management.

## Features

- **Member Management:** Easily manage community members and their associated information.
- **Supply Point Administration:** Efficiently handle points of supplies within the energy network.
- **Consumption Data Visualization:** Retrieve consumption data for each supply point to understand energy usage patterns.
- **Production Metrics Monitoring:** Track real-time data on energy production metrics from the plant.
- **Electricity Price Information:** Stay informed about current electricity prices for better decision-making.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+

### Configuration

#### JWT secret key

   The JWT secret key must be provided to be able to run the application and make calls to its API.

   You have to provide the secret key as an environment variable called `CONLUZ_JWT_SECRET_KEY`

   ```
   export CONLUZ_JWT_SECRET_KEY="b5f86373ba5d7593f4c6eab57862bf4be76369c1adbe263ae2d50ddae40b8ca2"
   ```

   The secret key must be compatible with [HMAC-SHA algorithms](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-3.2) and must have a length of 256 bits (32 bytes) or more.

   > **Note:**
   >
   > You can use the class `org.lucoenergia.conluz.infrastructure.shared.security.JwtSecretKeyGenerator` to generate a random JWT secret key.

#### Data storage
1. **PostgreSQL database**

Conluz uses a relational database mainly to store information about users and supplies.

So, to be able to use it, you need to have up and running a PostgreSQL database. 

You don't need to do an extra effort of creating all the table manually, because Conluz will do that for you during its bootstrap. Every time the app starts, will apply all the necessary changes to the database transparently using [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/) changesets.

> **Note:**
>
> To have a PostgreSQL database up and running in a few seconds, you can use the docker compose file `deploy/docker-compose.yaml`. This file will do automatically all the configurations required transparently.
> You just need to navigate to the `deploy` folder and execute the command `docker compose up -d`

2. **InfluxDB database**

TBD

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lucoenergia/conluz.git
   cd conluz
   ```

2. Build the application

    ```bash
   ./gradlew build
    ```
   
3. Run the application
   
   > **Important:**
   > 
   > Remember to apply all the configuration steps described above before start using the app.

    ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
    ```

    The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.


## Usage

### Initialize configuration

#### Default admin user

To be able to start using Conluz you must configure a user with administrative privileges.

This admin user will serve as the starting point for configuring additional users and the rest of the features related to the energy community.

The information that is required to provide to set up this admin user is:
- personal id
- password
- fullName
- email
- address

To be able to create that user you can use the `POST /api/v1/init` endpoint that does not require authentication providing a body like this:

```json
   {
      "defaultAdminUser":
      {
         "personalId": "01234567Z",
         "password": "a secure password!!",
         "fullName": "Energy Community Acme",
         "email": "adminemail@email.com",
         "address": "Fake Street 123 66633 Teruel (Spain)"
      }
   }
```

> **Important:**
>
> Once you initialize the default admin user for the first time, you will be unable to call this endpoint again. 
> 
> Instead, you should use the provided endpoints that require authentication.

### User Authentication

   When a user logs in or requests access to Conluz API, the authentication server generates a JWT token after verifying the user's credentials.

   The token contains information about the user (such as user ID, role, and expiration time) and is signed with a secret key known only to the authentication server.

   Example token payload:
   ```json
    {
         "sub": "92bd8615-f472-4331-8c90-8276cfb9441d",
         "iat": 1702663671,
         "exp": 1702665471,
         "role": "PARTNER"
    }
   ```

**Token Issuance**

   To get a valid token, firstly, a user must be configured in the application.
   
   Once the user is configured in the application, then you can use the `POST /api/v2/login` endpoint providing a body like this:
   ```json
    {
      "username": "01234567Z",
      "password": "a secure password!!"
    }
   ```

   If the login is successful, the server issues the JWT token to the client, which securely stores the token.

   Example login endpoint response:

   ```json
   {"token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIwMTIzNDU2N1oiLCJpYXQiOjE3MDMyODA2MTksImV4cCI6MTcwMzI4MjQxOX0.mNS-1EiY8tYDcVvrU_oR6Rlj9bpB3QNcSpqdP_7KH_o"}
   ```

**Token usage**

   The client includes the JWT token in the _Authorization_ header of subsequent API requests.

   ```
   GET /api/v1/users
   Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiMTIzNDU2IiwidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJleGFtcGxlX3VzZXIiLCJyb2xlIjoiYWRtaW4iLCJleHAiOjE2NzI1MzExOTl9.TI6nlzA1J7WV2rZq2ZC1U4FiG7YXYp3JO0_TPKKmWNE
   ```

**Token Verification**

   The Conluz API server receives the request and verifies the JWT signature using a secret key.

   If the signature is valid, the server extracts and decodes the information from the token to identify the user and determine their access rights.

   If the token is expired or the signature is invalid, the server denies access.

> JWT authentication provides a stateless and secure way to authenticate and authorize users in the Conluz application without the need for sessions or storing user information on the server.

### API docs

Conluz provides API documentation in OpenAPI format, allowing anyone to understand and interact with the available endpoints. 

> **Important!**
> 
> To be able to access the documentation, first of all, you have to **run the app**.

You can access the documentation using two methods:

### 1. Download OpenAPI Specification

You can download the OpenAPI specification in either YAML or JSON format to view the detailed documentation. Follow the steps below:

- Navigate to the [API Documentation](http://localhost:8080/api-docs) section.

Then you can download and inspect the specification using your preferred tool.

### 2. Swagger UI

Alternatively, you can access the API documentation through the Swagger UI, a user-friendly graphical interface. Follow these steps:

- Navigate to the [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/api-docs/swagger-ui/index.html) link.
- Explore and interact with the API endpoints in a visually appealing and intuitive way.
- Swagger UI provides an easy way to understand request and response formats, and even allows you to make sample requests directly from the documentation.
